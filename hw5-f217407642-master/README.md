In this work I analyze the titles of papers presented at the NIPS
conference from 1987 to 2017. The data in the provided (named file) `nips-titles.csv`, was loaded into
table `papers`, contains only two columns, `year` and `title` from the
[original Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers).
