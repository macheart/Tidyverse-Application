Homework 2

Grade: 4

Good work, and the following are tiny suggestions:

--We also expect to see the comments on the patterns of cancellation across origin airports in question 2, besides the pattern across carriers

--it would be better to also note the spike in the curves in the summer time (mid-year) in question 4 where LGA seems to have most cancellation
