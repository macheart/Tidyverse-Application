# Homework 4

Grade: 3.5


Great job in question 2,3 and 4 and the codes are all correct, as well as observations of data patterns, except the following details to note: 

--in question 1, we also need to check the unusual values in age, martial status and purchase. The suggested codes are in the solution posted on blackboard.

--in question 4, it would be better to also notice an overal negative relationship between price and purchase, because many cheaper goods have larger purchase amounts than the expensive ones.
