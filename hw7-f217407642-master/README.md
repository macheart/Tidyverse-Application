# Homework 7

Grade: 3


Good job. The  answers are complete with results and analyses on all questions. The major codes are correct, despite several details, 

--in question 2, the estimation results are a little bit different from that in the solution, which probably leads to different prediction result. Similarly in question 4, the estimation results are different froom the solution, leading to different prediction, though the major code, which implements the logic regression without intercept, is correct.
